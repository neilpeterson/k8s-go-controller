# Kubernetes burst scheduler

Simple scheduler that will burst workload to a named node after a specified number of related pods have been started.

## Attribution

This is my first go project and first exposure to the Kubernetes go client. Throughout, these two resources have been invaluable. Many thanks to the contributing teams.

## Example use case:

**Environment:**

You have a Kubernetes cluster with three nodes. [Virtual Kublet](https://github.com/virtual-kubelet/virtual-kubelet) has been configured to present Azure Container Instances as a virtual node on the cluster. The cluster looks like this:

```
NAME                                   STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION
aks-nodepool1-34059843-0               Ready     agent     9h        v1.7.7
aks-nodepool1-34059843-1               Ready     agent     9h        v1.7.7
aks-nodepool1-34059843-2               Ready     agent     9h        v1.7.7
virtual-kubelet-myaciconnector-linux   Ready     agent     2m        v1.8.3
```

A batch processing routine automatically starts Kubernetes jobs on the Kuebrentes. On average, less than 10 of these jobs are running at any given time. Occasionally an event occurs that temporarily increases this workload above 10 concurrent jobs. 

You would like to primarily run all jobs on the Kubernetes nodes, however when the number of concurrent jobs increases above 10, these pods should be scheduled on Azure Container Instances by the virtual kublet.

With these desired results, the Kubernetes Burst Scheduler can be used to burst job 11, 12, ... to the `virtual-kubelet-myaciconnector-linux` node.

## Deployment

The following manifest can be used to start the scheduler. Update `<node-name>` with the name of the burst node, and `<integer>` with the burst value. See the next section for details on all possible arguments.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: burst-scheduler
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: burst-scheduler
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: kubectl-sidecar
        image: neilpeterson/kubectl-proxy-sidecar
      - name: burst-scheduler
        image: neilpeterson/burst-scheduler:v1
        args: ["--burstNode", "<node-name>", "--burstValue", "<integer>"]
```

## Execution

```
burst-scheduler --burstNode virtual-kubelet-myaciconnector-linux --burstValue 10
```

Arguments:

| Argument | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| schedulerName | String | The name of the scheduler, this will match the named scheduler when deploying pods. The default value os burst-scheduler. |
| burstNode | String | Node name of the burst node. This is the node on which pods are scheduled once the burstValue has been met. |
| burstValue | Int | Value that controls how many pods will be scheduled on Kubernetes nodes vs. burst node. |
| kubeConfig | Bool | Indicates that a kubernetes config file found at $KUBECONFIG is used for cluster discovery / auth. If not specified, it is assumed execution is occurring from a pod in the Kubernetes cluster. |

## TODO:

**Terminating pods** â€“ filter these from scope. Not a big issue but can be problematic during demos / quick turn-a-rounds.

**Namespace** - currently 'default' is a non-configurable default. Update with a `--namespace` argument.

**Default Scheduler** - Update pod updater to use default scheduler when not in burst. Currently a random node from all nodes - the burst node is chosen for scheduling. I am not able to patch the pod scheduler property value.

**Pod node assignment** - Update this to use go client method, go client rest interface. Currently the node assignment is handled through direct api call (via kubectl proxy / sidecar). I was unable to use podInterface.update due to a non-updatable property (error below). Is there a way to complete through the go client, if not I see the that there is a REST interface, this is probably a better way to achieve this.

```
"aci-helloworld-4142002832-3l873" is invalid: spec: Forbidden: pod updates may not change fields other than `spec.containers[*].image`, `spec.initContainers[*].image`, `spec.activeDeadlineSeconds` or `spec.tolerations` (only additions to existing tolerations)

## Incubation?

**Pseudo Re-scheduler** - could solve the problem with bursting a deployment. As the replica count reaches burst value (on pod delete), check pod balance. if pods are scheduled on a burst node, stop pod, which should then be rescheduled on a node via the custom scheduler - perhaps?
